## Why This Exists ‚ùì  
Editing SSH configs (`~/.ssh/config`) and managing keys is a repetitive task. 
After the 100th search for `ssh-add -K` , I built this tool to:

- üñ±Ô∏è **Replace terminal** with a clean GUI.  
- üîë Simplify **key management** (RSA, Ed25519) and **passphrase integration** with macOS Keychain and config file edition.
---

## Features ‚ú®  
- **GUI SSH Config Editor**: Visualize, edit, and validate `~/.ssh/config` files.  
- **Key Management**: Generate, delete, and organize SSH keys.
- **macOS Keychain Integration**: Securely store passphrases without CLI hacks.  
- **Modern Stack**: Built with **Electron**, **Vue 3**, and **Shadcn UI**.

### Build DMG
In order to build a DMG you can install on other Macbook than yours you'll need to notarize the exported DMG. To do that you can follow the [following steps to create your needed credentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYBLfjT57hU) and fil-out the .env file with your informations. Also uncomment the lines in forge.config.js file to use osxNotarize.
